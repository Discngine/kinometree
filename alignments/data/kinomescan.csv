In screening for small-molecule compounds that are effective at killing cancer cells, one-dimensional readout GI50, which is the EC50 value of growth inhibition, is usually used as the only criterion. A major problem with this one-readout approach is that other useful information is discarded, which could be critical for understanding the action of the compounds. In this screen, we use a single-cell-based imaging assay that can report multi-dimensional physiological responses in cells treated with small molecule kinase inhibitors. The data in this dataset are described in PMID: 23788527: Differential Determinants of Cancer Cell Insensitivity to Antimitotic Drugs Discriminated by a One-Step Cell Imaging Assay (J. Biomolecular Screening, 2013).

(2013) Nature Chemical Biology: <i>Large-scale analysis of cellular response to anticancer drugs typically focuses on variation in potency (half-maximum inhibitory concentration, (IC50)), assuming that it is the most important difference between effective and ineffective drugs or sensitive and resistant cells. We took a multiparametric approach involving analysis of the slope of the dose-response curve, the area under the curve and the maximum effect (Emax). We found that some of these parameters vary systematically with cell line and others with drug class. For cell-cycle inhibitors, Emax often but not always correlated with cell proliferation rate. For drugs targeting the Akt/PI3K/mTOR pathway, dose-response curves were unusually shallow. Classical pharmacology has no ready explanation for this phenomenon, but single-cell analysis showed that it correlated with significant and heritable cell-to-cell variability in the extent of target inhibition. We conclude that parameters other than potency should be considered in the comparative analysis of drug response, particularly at clinically relevant concentrations near and above the IC50.</i)","Fallahi-Sichani M, Honarnejad, S  Heiser, LM, Gray JW and Sorger PK.

PMID: 24013279), this assay focuses on drugs inhibiting the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway that varied widely in Hill slope (HS) and Emax values independent of proliferation rate. For six compounds with varying HS, target inhibition was measured by immunofluorescence microscopy and cell killing in four breast cell lines (HER2-amplified AU565 and HCC1954 cancer cells, hormone receptor-positive T47D cancer cells, and non-transformed MCF10A cells). The effects of the mTOR inhibitor PP242, PI3K inhibitor GSK1059615, dual specificity mTOR/PI3K inhibitor dactolisib (BEZ235), Akt inhibitors MK2206 and triciribine, and also an EGFR inhibitor gefitinib were probed 6 hr and 24 hr after drug exposure in 9-point dose-response assays using antibodies specific for p-ERK (Thr202/Tyr204), p-Akt (Ser473), p-4EBP1 (Thr37/46), and p-S6 (Ser235/236). A shallow dose-response curve is correlated with high cell-to-cell variability in target (p-4EBP1) inhibition by PP242 and dactolisib as compared to drugs for which HS ~ 1 or HS > 1 (in four of four cell lines tested).

The assay has three components: a kinase-tagged phage, a test compound, and an immobilized ligand that the compound competes with to displace the kinase. The amount of kinase bound to the immobilized ligand is determined using quantitative PCR of the DNA tag.  Results for each kinase are reported as ""Percent of control"", where the control is DMSO and where a 100% result means no inhibition of kinase binding to the ligand in the presence of the compound, and where low percent results mean strong inhibition. The KINOMEscan data are presented graphically on TREEspot Kinase Dendrograms (http://www.kinomescan.com/Tools---Resources/Study-Reports---Data-Analysis).  For this study, HMS LINCS investigators have graphed results for kinases classified as 35 ""percent of control"" (in the presence of the compound, the kinase is 35% as active for binding ligand in the presence of DMSO), 5 ""percent of control"" and 1 ""percent of control"".","KINOMEscan website: <a href = ""http://www.discoverx.com/technologies-platforms/competitive-binding-technology/kinomescan-technology-platform"" target=""blank"">Overview & Assay Principle</a><br />

20260,LINCS Pilot Phase Joint Project: Sensitivity measures of six breast cancer cell lines to a library of small molecule kinase inhibitors (drug combination treatments). Dataset 2 of 2: Mean cell count and mean normalized growth rate inhibition values across technical replicates.,,,"As described in HMS LINCS Datasets #20245-20252, measures of the sensitivities of six cell lines to a library of small molecule inhibitors were generated by treating cells with single drugs at six doses starting at 10 µM in 3x dilution steps and measuring cell number after three days of drug exposure. Based on those results, a subset of the drugs was chosen for analysis of combinatorial drug sensitivities in a single cell line (Datasets #20259 and #20260).
